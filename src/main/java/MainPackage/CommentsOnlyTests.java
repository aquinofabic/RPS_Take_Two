/*
 Design tests to cover various aspects of the game's functionality.
 Rock paper scissors tests:


Test for INPUT HANDLING
- Test that handles valid inputs (RPS) correctly
- Ignores case sensitivity
- rejects invalid inputs


Test for GAME LOGIC
- Game correctly determines the winner when given valid inputs
- Game handles different combinations of inputs, (R vs S, S vs P,...)
    and determines the winner appropriately


Test for RANDOM SELECTION
- Since computer's choice is random, test that the computer's move is indeed random and not
    biased towards a particular choice.


Test for MULTIPLE ROUNDS
 - Test that the game can handle multiple rounds and keep track of the score correctly


Test for GAME OVER
- Game correctly identifies when it's game over (certain number of rounds)
    and declares a winner


Test for SOLID Principles
- Single
- Open/Closed
- Liskov Substitution
- Interface Segregation
- Dependency Inversion


Test for ERROR HANDLING
- Game handles unexpected scenarios gracefully and provides appropriate error message when necessary


Test for User Interface (Optional)
- If you have a user interface (e.g., a command-line interface), test that it correctly displays information
    and interacts with the game logic.
